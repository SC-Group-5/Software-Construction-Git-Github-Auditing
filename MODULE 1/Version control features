   - diff:this helps in spoting out the difference inase there are changes applied
   it follows the following syntax  " diff file1.py file2.py", this mean that the diff will give us the diference in file1.py and file2.py
   Moreso the < represents the removed infomation from the file and the > sign represents what extra informatin has been added to the file.
   - The second command is " diff -u file1.py file2.py", this changes from use of < or > to use of -- and ++ respectively.
How to apply changes
   -Command 1 " patch with a < sign " : incase file1.py has an error and someone corrects the error in the a different file named fil2.py,
    to appply those changes to file1.py, we shall use this command " patch file1.py < file2.py"

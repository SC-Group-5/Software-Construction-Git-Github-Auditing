# Git & Github Learning and Auditing Repository

This repository presents our group’s learning experience while auditing Google’s Introduction to Git and GitHub course on Coursera.

It is intended to demonstrate our practical understanding of version control concepts, Git and GitHub usage, and collaborative workflows through structured documentation, commits, and hands-on exercises aligned with each course module.

# Structure
The repository is arranged according to the course modules. Within each module, there are folders for individual contributors alongside shared demonstration files where required.

# Collaboration Workflow

Modules 1–2: Contributors make direct commits to the main branch within their respective folders.

Module 3: Remote repositories are introduced, with limited use of branching.

Module 4: Development follows a branch-based workflow, incorporating pull requests, peer reviews, and controlled merges into the main branch.

This progression reflects the gradual introduction of version control and collaboration concepts throughout the course.
